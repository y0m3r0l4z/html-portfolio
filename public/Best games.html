<h2>Top 3 platforming games of all time.</h2>

<h3>Super Metroid (snes)</h3>
<p>This game is to me almost a perfect creation as it tell us a great story thru gameplay only and the replayablilitie is only limited to the players abilities, since instead of placing invisible barriers to reach parts of the game, you can access the whole map with almost nothing but your basic movement. 
<br>
The developers made this intentional and in can be seen on the previews screens with special abilities that are not tought to you in a tutorial but in gameplay.

<h3>Megaman X (snes)</h3>
<p>This is the follow up to the "Jump and shoot" gameplay that was created with the original searies on the Nes, at a time when the gameplay was starting to get stale, comes CAPCOM to reinvent the wheel this spin off searies made us forget all that we knew about the old stile of gameplay with 2 simple mechanics, the wall jump/hold and the dash, mechanics that  would provide us a new much needed sence of speed to the game and would be the basis for many future games.</p>
<h3>Castlevania: Simphony of the Night (ps1/sega saturn)</h3>
<p>This game was a natural evolution for me as it mixes elements from metroid such as the exploration and also a bit of the movement from megaman as well as the original castlevania searies and a touch of rpg elemets such a leveling up and wepon selection.
<br>
This is where the platform dungeon explorer games started to be called "MetroidVanias" and created a whole new gameplay style that is still imitated to this day with games like "The Messanger", "hallow knight" and "bloodstained".
